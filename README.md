# OctaNet To-Do List App

Welcome to the OctaNet To-Do List App project! In this project, you will create a dynamic web-based to-do list using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This to-do list will empower users to organize and manage their tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an interactive to-do list application that provides users with a simple and intuitive way to manage their tasks. Users should be able to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks they no longer need.

### Key Features
1. **Task Creation**: Users can easily add new tasks to the to-do list.

2. **Task Editing**: Tasks can be edited to change their details or due dates.

3. **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed, making it easy to track their progress.

4. **Task Deletion**: Unwanted or completed tasks can be deleted from the list.

5. **Task Prioritization**: Implement task prioritization features to help users manage their tasks effectively.

6. **User-Friendly UI**: Create an intuitive user interface with an appealing design using HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: You'll need a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and a web browser to get started. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is beneficial.

2. **Clone this Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OctaNet/ToDoListApp.git
   ```

3. **Project Structure**: The project has the following structure:

   ```
   ToDoListApp/
   ├── index.html
   ├── styles/
   │   └── styles.css
   ├── scripts/
   │   └── app.js
   └── video/
       └── Data Analytics.mp4 
   ```

4. **Edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Open the `index.html` file in your code editor to modify the HTML structure. Style your to-do list in the `styles/style.css` file, and implement functionality in the `scripts/script.js` file.

5. **Test Locally**: You can preview your to-do list by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. Test the application locally to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

6. **Customization**: Customize the application's appearance, user experience, and additional features according to OctaNet's preferences and branding.
